# LSE_straddle
Level Set Estimation with straddle acquisition function

## Overview
Level set estimation (LSE) is the problem of identifying regions where the value of function is greater than or equal to the threshold value.
I deal with efficient LSE using active learning.

I use straddle acquisition function.
Straddle acquisition function is based on uncertainty about classification.
